## 🧠 What Is a Warframe Aimbot?

A **Warframe aimbot** is a real-time cheat tool that automatically snaps or silently aims your crosshair at enemies. It calculates distance, target movement, and even prioritizes **headshots or boss hit zones**.

It can run:

* As a **soft aim assist** (human-looking)
* Or as a **rage aimbot** (snap-to-target with 100% accuracy)

Combine it with infinite energy or auto-fire and you've got **next-level Warframe domination**.
